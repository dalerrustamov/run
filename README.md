# run
RunTransactons simulates transactions being processed on bank accounts. There is always a chance that more than one thread will want to update an account at the same time. In that case, ATMs that are being used by the same account at the same time by different by different users might not get the most up-to-date account information(balance), which causes banks financial loss. So the program uses critical sections to avoid that issue, and make other thread wait until the account is ready to be reused without giving users any errors.
